This is an automated guessing game. In this program a random number between 0-9 is picked and three players (programmed) take turns picking random numbers until one of the three players randomly guesses the correct number. the boolean value of the guesses are displayed once a player has won.

once all three classes have been compiled run the GameLauncher to watch the game play out.
